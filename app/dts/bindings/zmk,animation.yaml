compatible: "zmk,animation"

properties:
  drivers:
    type: phandles
    required: true
    description: |
      This array should contain all driver devices responsible for illuminating animated LEDs.
      The devices must implement Zephyr's LED Strip Interface and expose a chain-lenght devicetree property.

  animations:
    type: phandles
    required: true
    description: |
      Handles to all active animations.

  pixels:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
    description: |
      This field contains the pixel configuration for the entire board.
      The order of this array determines in what order pixels are sent to the driver device API.
      If multiple driving devices are used, their chain-length property determines the size of the buffer for each device.
